# NexusBot
This is a bot for all mode player. Easy to use some Bathbot command.

# IMPORTANT
The information sent to Discord is similar, as it is based on Bathbot, but the code is completely different. I wrote everything from beginning to end.

This bot is a rewritten code of AeroBot a.k.a. Hoshino Bot to support all modes. the layout of the one sent to Discord (Embed) is almost all the same.
